This is a larger example of what CNoEvil/OGW code looks like.

It was made by following and translating this [tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

You'll note that some complicated things, like an array of function pointers, is just the C equivalent. This is fine and normal. CNoEvil/OGW is a _superset_ of C. Everything that is C, is valid.
